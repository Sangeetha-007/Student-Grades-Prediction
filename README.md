# Student-Grades-Prediction

Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict student exam scores using academic, behavioral, and demographic features on a dataset with 63,000 rows. Optimized the Linear Regression model with a Neural Network. Engineered numerical and categorical features using StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, and OrdinalEncoder via a ColumnTransformer to prevent data leakage.
