# Student-Grades-Prediction

Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict student exam scores using academic, behavioral, and demographic features. Optimized the Linear Regression model with a Neural Network. Engineered numerical and categorical features using StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, and OrdinalEncoder via a ColumnTransformer to prevent data leakage.

## Technologies Used
* Python: pandas, NumPy, Neural Network, Linear Regression, Matplotlib, seaborn
